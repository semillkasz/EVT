## Abstract
One of todayâ€™s problems is the lack of quality education in some countries. People around the world do not have access to the education everyone deserves, which is why the United Nations set goals to diminish this problem by 2030. Despite all their efforts, majority of the New Zealand public remain unaware of the issue. As a result, the government does not pay much attention to the problem that leads to people not taking action or not knowing which actions to take in resolving it. The aim of this project is to implement and design an interactive software visualisation prototype that can help the New Zealand public be informed about the lack of quality education around the globe. The prototype will help its users to engage with the problem better that can stimulate desire to help out United Nations to deliver their goals.
